FRC 2010 Vision Demonstration Program
-------------------------------------
This demonstartion program shows how to track to the FRC 2010 game target
using the AxisCamera class. The demo uses the camera to get the heading to
the target, then uses a Gyro to turn to that heading. In addition, this
program will display data from the I/O ports on the cRIO and Camera tracking
information onto the LabVIEW sample dashboard.
